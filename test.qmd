## Introduction

Over the years, there has been an increase in the health awareness of the Scottish population, with a fear that the country as a whole is becoming overweight. The body mass index (BMI) is a quick way to measure weight relative to height, and screen for people that are underweight, overweight, or obese.

We aim to answer two questions:

1.  Has the BMI in Scotland changed over the given years of the Scottish Health Survey?

2.  Are there any difference in the BMI distributions by age, gender, socio-economic status or lifestyle factors?
